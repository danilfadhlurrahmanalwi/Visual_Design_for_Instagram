#### Project Description 
This project involved the dissemination and documentation of activities carried out during the Nusantara module and the collaborative activities throughout the Indonesian International Student Mobility Program (Program Pertukaran Mahasiswa Merdeka) Batch 4. As the head of the division, I was responsible for designing Instagram feed posts and Instagram stories. I delegated the documentation tasks and account management to other team members to ensure that our division could work in a focused and organized manner. When designing the feed and Instagram stories, I used the Canva application. To efficiently design multiple Instagram feed posts at once and to maintain a clean and cohesive feed layout, I consistently applied the grid method.
